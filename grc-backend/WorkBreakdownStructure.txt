Project Work Breakdown Structure & Implementation Plan


Project: GRC-Core & ITSM Platform (On-Premise)
Version: 1.1 (EU Requirements Update)
________________


1. Executive Summary & Estimation Methodology


This document outlines the complete work breakdown and implementation plan for building the on-premise GRC & ITSM Platform. The project is structured into distinct phases, designed to be executed by a multi-disciplinary team.
Estimation Methodology:
All effort is estimated in man-hours. This is a direct estimate of the time required for a single, qualified professional (e.g., a senior developer, a UX designer) to complete the task.
It is important to note that estimating software development in hours is inherently complex and subject to change. These estimates are provided for planning and budgeting purposes and represent our professional judgment, not a fixed-price guarantee. The total hours for a phase can be distributed across a team; for example, a 160-hour phase can be completed by two people in two weeks (80 hours each).
Total Estimated Effort: 1,212 Man-Hours

2. Project Governance & Tooling (Critical Success Factors)


Before development begins, a "real plan" requires a framework for management, communication, and quality control.
* Core Team Roles (Assumed):
   * Project Manager: Owns the schedule, budget, and this WBS.
   * Lead Backend Engineer (Go): Owns the API, database, and backend logic.
   * Lead Frontend Engineer (Next.js): Owns the UI/UX implementation for both internal and external platforms.
   * UX/UI Designer: Owns the user-flow, wireframes, and high-fidelity mockups.
   * QA Engineer: Owns the test plan, automation, and bug-tracking.
* Recommended Toolchain:
   * Project Management: Jira, Asana, or OpenProject for managing tasks, sprints, and this WBS.
   * Code Repositories: Bitbucket or GitLab (3 separate repos: grc-backend, grc-frontend-platform, grc-frontend-portal).
   * API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI. The Go backend should auto-generate an openapi.json file to serve as the "contract" for the frontend team.
   * UI Component Library: Storybook. The Next.js projects should use Storybook to build and document UI components in isolation, ensuring consistency and speeding up development.
* Project Cadence (Agile):
   * Sprints: Two-week development cycles.
   * Meetings: Daily Stand-ups (15 min), Sprint Planning (start of sprint), Sprint Review (end of sprint).
